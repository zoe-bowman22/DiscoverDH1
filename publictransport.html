 	Best arrive by train for breath-taking high view of the city. Trains run on the East Coast Main Line from London Kings Cross and York as far as Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh. Trains also run from lots of other places including Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. Durham train station is a short walk from the city centre and is connected to the Cathedral by the Cathedral Bus, which operates every twenty minutes from circa 0700 to 1740. An all-day ticket costs 50p.

	By road, Durham is easily reached from the A1(M). From December 2005, a Park & Ride service has operated from three sites on the outskirts of the city centre. Most useful of which is the Belmont Park & Ride, located approximately 300 yards from junction 62 of the A1(M), towards Sunderland on the A690.

	A bus service operates every twenty minutes between the Park & Ride and the city centre, 0700 - 1900 hours. There is no free parking in the City Centre, although there are several car parks, and solar powered meters everywhere. However, parking at the meter is free on Sunday and in the evenings. There is free parking at all 3 Park & Ride centres, but the P&R bus is £1.70 per person. This includes use of all P&R buses for the day. The P&R is highly recommended as Durham was not built for today's traffic. As a result it is very congested, although cars are generally kept away from the main shopping areas with the help of the country's first congestion charge. The congestion charge is £2 and runs from 10:00 - 16:00 on exit (i.e. you may enter at any time without charge - you are only charged to leave the congestion charge zone between 10:00 and 16:00). Payment is by coin only.
